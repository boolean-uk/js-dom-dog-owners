- Breakdown tasks a step at a time. Start by adding a list item to the top of the page for each dog.
- Then, add an event listener on click.
- Then, in that event listener, just display the dogs name on the page.
- From there, you can build up the information on the card (add the image, then the bio, etc)

Finally, if you are really stuck, you can use the `index-starting.js` file - copy the contents in to your index.js file and update the sections marked with `TODO`. Work through the TODO sections in the order they are numbered - i.e. (1) first, (2) second, etc.
